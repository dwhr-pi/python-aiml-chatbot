### Reminders
This bot implements the flow of a new reminder creation.

This Botscript contains an [empty context](https://docs.zenbot.org/botscript/conversations/) called "reminder" which makes the final step of the dialog.
It also illustrates how you can use the idea of context referencing by ID.

### How to Use
Send requests like "Remind me to call mom tomorrow" or "Buy flowers in 3 hours".
This bot supports conversation, so you can provide only a part of the phrase and bot will ask you about reminder text, date and time.

### Doit Bot
There is a production version of this bot - [Doit bot](https://doitbot.netlify.com) which works with both English and Russian in Telegram and Slack messengers.
